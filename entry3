Today I felt like I was behind... Due to my lack of proper planning I
am a little behind on the assignments. But after the "lecture" and after receiving the
hw and working with Shayne I feel a lot better about my progress. I need to buckle down this weekend
re-submit some hw and go over the reading again and make more notes. :)
Everyone says week 2 is the hardest... I need to make sure I am prepared.
