# Day 4
Handlebars was introduced today. At first it did not seem very helpful,
but after the pair programing lab I got to appreciate how much it helps.
So far I am comprehending most of what is being introduced a day or 2 after it
was introduced, but feel like I'm catching up. Hopefully I can get caught up on the weekend.
