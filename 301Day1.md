# Day1

Today we started with pair programing. Nathan and I worked as driver and navigator
through 5 *TODO* tasks. The lecture made it easy to understand and we worked through them pretty quickly. Now I am faced with thinking through my portfolio page. I have no idea how I want to structure it yet.
The amount of assignments we received  today was quite a bit more than I expected.
Time to get back to the grind.
