# Day 10

Functional programing. Today we were introduced to .forEach(), .map(), .filter(), and .reduce().
They seem like they will be very beneficial once I understand how to use them well. We also learned about arrow functions. These seem to be pretty straight forward and I think I have a decent grasp of how to use them, but will definitely do a little research to make sure I am using them correctly.
This is going to be a weekend full of reviewing haha. Yay weekend haha.
