#Class 20 Journal
Today we made the final touches on the group projects and presented them.
Looking back at the week I am happy with the progress we made and how much we learned
together as a group. I think we made a great site and plan to keep working on it in the future.
All the group projects were great and impressive. It amazes me to  look back at where
I started 4 weeks ago and see where I am now. I hope to continue in 301 in a week.
