# Day 2

jQuery was formally introduced today. It was amazing to see how all the work we did in 2015
was so easily duplicated. After the lecture I was a bit confused with all the material that was
introduced and will have a lot of reading and research to do. The arrow functions completely baffle me at the moment but I think they will be explained in more detail later on.
