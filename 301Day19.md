# Day 19

Well I didn't turn in my journal for last night because I spaced on it due to working on the project haha but I am happy to say that we are making steady progress on it. Unfortunately we are not as close to being done as we had hoped we would be by this point, but making a big push to get things done tonight. I have faith that we can have a presentable product by 1:30 tomorrow afternoon.... hopefully hahaha
