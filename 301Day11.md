# Day 11

I am feeling a little behind and lost after learning about the page.js introduction today.
There are many things that I feel like I don't understand well enough, but I am hoping that with some review and time I will understand them better. The only thing is that I don't have a lot of time to be reviewing material that we have covered due to all the new information that is introduced daily. I am definitely feeling the pressure starting out on week 3.
