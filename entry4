Fifth day, fourth journal log. I felt like I was getting the hang of everything
today. I still have a long way to go with my css but I think with some time
I will get to where I want to be. There is still quite a lot to learn, but I am
focused on keeping up and making sure I finish what needs to be done first.
Hope I can catch up this weekend!
