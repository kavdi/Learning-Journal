# Day 17

We have made great progress with our app, and it is finally looking like something we can present.
There is a good api connection where we are getting information and sending information back. I am happy with our team and the way we work together. The TAs are always ready to help and very patient with us when we need to understand anything. I am happy to say I am happy with where we are at today.
