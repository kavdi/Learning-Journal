First two days have flown by. I am not sure if I'm grasping everything that is
being said, but so far I have been able to keep up and not feel like I'm drowning.
I need to take more time and practice the skills I am learning so they can become
second nature to me. So far I like the way the class is being taught, although
Nick does go a little fast. I will definitely have to rewatch some of the lessons haha.
Well I hope this is ok for the first entry. cheers!
