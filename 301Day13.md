# Day 13

Today we learned about heroku and how to use it as our platform for our web apps.
I was definitely confused by the process at first but after the lab assignment I got more of a grasp of how to do it. I am a little behind on the portfolio project so I will have to wait a little bit before I set it up for that. Week 3 is ending and there is so much I have tried to learn but seem to not remember.. if that makes any sense haha. I am glad that we will be building something from scratch these next two days because it will bring everything that we have learned together.
